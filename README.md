### Assignment 0
_**Assignment 0**: Each one of the datasets has properties which makes
them hard to learn. Motivate which of the three problems is most
difficult for a decision tree algorithm to learn_.

The MONK-2 dataset would be the hardest to learn because every variable is independent from each other.  
The MONK-1 dataset could also be hard to learn because it could take time to realise that a1 and a2 has to be equal.  
It would be easiest to learn the MONK-3 dataset because there it would be easier to see that every time a5 and a4 is 1 or every time a5 is not 4 and a2 is not 3 it would be true.
